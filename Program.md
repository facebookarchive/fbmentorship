# Facebook Open Source Pilot Mentorship Program

Facebook Open Source is working on a pilot program to introduce developers to open source via a 4-week mentorship program. In this program, mentees will be mentored by a Facebook Engineer to work on a selected Facebook open source project.

As a mentee, you are expected to commit 10 hours per week to complete the tasks assigned by your mentor. Your mentor will meet you online every week to review your code and answer any questions you have.

At the end of the program, we’ll provide feedback on how you did, what worked well, and areas to improve on. We’ll look for candid feedback on the program and how it was run. This is especially important since this is a pilot program and we want good guidance as we look to expand it. We also want to leverage the program to create training materials that can be used in many future open source training forums and you may be a part of a pioneering group that helps author this material.

## Who

We invite any applicants with a passion for tech. No open source experience necessary but experience using Facebook open source projects is a plus. We’re looking for a diverse range of experiences.

## Where

Online mentorship weekly with check-in meetings.

## When

There are two sessions or waves:

* February 23rd - March 23rd
* February 28th - March 28th.

We’re expecting a 10-hour weekly time commitment on average for mentees, so approximately 40 hours.
