# Coding

At this point you should have a good handle on the contribution workflow after completing the previous exercises.

For developer peeps, this exercise allows you to play around and contribute code.

The code you'll be looking at is written in JavaScript. Don't worry if you have little to no experience with JavaScript. You should be able to look at the code in question and get an idea of what's happening.

### Instructions

Take a look at the `js` folder in the top-level. It should have some JavaScript function in standalone files. Some work, some may have been written under an extreme lack of sleep.

Your mission is to fix the broken code and if you feel brave, add your own new functions.

Fixing the broken:

1. Check out the [contributing guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info around what's expected.
1. Find the bad code.
1. Send a pull request with your fixes for the bad code.
1. Go through the pull request review phase.
1. Profit!

Adding new functions:

1. Check out the [contributing guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info around what's expected.
1. Add your new function.
1. Send a pull request with your additions. Don't forget to add tests!
1. Go through the pull request review phase.
1. Profit even more!

### Testing changes

**Online**

You can test your code fixes online starting with this [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/caabernathy/822ur38d/). It's pre-filled with some of the functions that currently exist in the `js` folder. Watchful eyes may notice some new functions that this repo doesn't have. At least for now.

**Locally**

You could even run tests locally using [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/). See the [contributing guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more instructions on setting this up.
