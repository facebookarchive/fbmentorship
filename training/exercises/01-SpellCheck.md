# Greatness ensues

Developer Friends and People,

This is the best learning and mentoring project you will come across (or at least that is our goal!)

I need your help! Because one of us isn't as smart as all of us put together!

Your first mission, should you chose to accept it, is to edit what you find and fix all the really odd things and spelling mistakes throughout the documentation. I appreciate your helping me fix them.

I'd also love to see code and your ideas. The more code, the better. Together and collectively, we can strive to improve this experience and in more ways than I can anticipate.
 
ENJOY!!
