# Greatness ensues

Developer Friends and People,

This is one of the best learning and mentoring project you will come across or at least that is our goal!

I need your help as one of us isn't as smart as all of us put together.

Your first mission is to edit what you find wrong and fix all the really odd things and spelling mistakes throughout the document. I appreciate your efforts in helping me fix them!

I'd also love to see your code and your ideas. The more you code, the better we can strive to improve this experience. Together and collectively in more ways than I anticipated.
 
ENJOY!!
