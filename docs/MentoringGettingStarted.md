As part of [the mentorship program](ProgramOverview.md), you'll guide external developers as they learn the ropes around open source contribution. They'll do this by working on an existing open source project, most likely a Facebook project.

## Expectations

As a mentor, you're expected to be the main point of contact for the mentees who want to make meaningful contributions to open source.

**You are their main point of contact, and the majority of the mentee's experience (good or bad) will depend on you!**

The goal of the program is to get mentees familiar with making open source contributions and making them self sufficient. It's perfectly fine if they don't make a large amount of contributions. The goal is that they're able to dig in on their own and make a contribution independently by the end of gthe program. 

As a mentor, you'll be expected to:

* **Teach**:
    * Help mentees get familiar with how to make open source contributions.
    * Help mentees understand how to write good commits.
    * Help mentees write good, clean code.
    * Teach mentees how to effectively communicate and navigate the world of open source. Teach them the skills needed to be an effective team player in a larger software engineering team.
    * Help mentees grow their own mentoring skills. We want mentees to pay it forward by becoming mentors for people in the future. Try to have them identify issues they can train others on.
* **Support**:
    * Answer any technical questions mentees may have. You don't have to know the right answer, but you should help them figure out how to get an answer, You can do this by helping them read code or by contacting project maintainers.
    * Help mentees with any concerns they may have about the program, personally or technically.
    * Understand what mentees want to get out of the program and work with them to achieve their goals. For example, do they want to make a ton of contributions? Or do they just want to learn how to make one really good contribution?
    * (Optional but strongly suggested) Maintain contact and periodically check-in with mentees long after the program ends.
* **Manage**:
    * Make sure mentees are progressing at a reasonable rate.
    * Check-in to make sure mentees are supported and not blocked on external factors.
    * Provide feedback to program admins on how mentees are progressing.
    * Gather feedback from mentees about the program.
    * Provide feedback to program admins about your mentoring experience.
