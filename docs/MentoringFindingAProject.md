Mentorship projects can come from three sources:

* Provided by the program admins
* Hand picked by you
* Suggested by the mentee

## Preset Projects

As a mentor in this program, you'll have a set of mentorship projects provided by the project admins to choose from. Each of these projects should have starter tasks to help onboard the mentee. This is likely the easiest path if you're familiar with the projects or the technology behind them.

## Your Own Project

You may also wish to work with a project outside of the preset list. Typically these would be projects that you're very familiar with, either as a project maintainer or close collaborator.

When scoping a project, keep the following in mind:

* How long would it take you to work on it given your experience?
* How would you rate the difficulty level - beginner, intermediate, complex?
* What skills are needed to complete the project?

Based on these answers you can describe and match the project with your mentee's background and skill level.

## Mentee Suggested Project

The mentee may have a strong desire to work on a project they select themselves. It could be based on an issue they encountered during the preset project onboarding or one they've experienced when using an open source project.

Feel free to explore this option if you're comfortable with the project. You'll want to take some time scoping the project with them to make sure it's meaty enough for the mentorship program.
