The Facebook Open Source Mentorship progam runs 6 weeks and has flexible start dates to accommodate different geographies and audience time constraints.

The following describes a typical mentorship timeline. Keep in mind that this may run differently depending on availability, unplanned roadblocks, or project complexity. 

| Description  | Notes  |
|---|---|
| **Pre-Mentorship**  |---|
| Mentor/mentee matchup | Program admin matches mentors with mentees based on interests and availability.|
| Mentorship kick-off meeting | Mentor schedules an initial meeting with the mentee. This should preferably be done through video conferencing.<br/><br/>Meeting should discuss expectations, communication, initial training, and potential projects. Follow-on checkpoint meetings should then be setup.|
| **Week 1**  |---|
| Git and GitHub trainiing | Mentee completes initial training and exercises around the basics of open source contribution.<br/><br/>Mentor reviews the work and provides any needed guidance.|
| Project onboarding tasks  | Mentee completes starter tasks related to the area of interest. At the end of the exercise mentor and mentee can evaluate product fit and potentially switch projects. |
| Checkpoint meeting  | Mentor and mentee meet to evaluate progress.<br/><br/>We recommend two meetings in the first week. |
| **Week 2**  |---|
| Start of project | Mentee claims an assignment described in a GitHub project's issue and begins working on it.<br/><br/>This takes place once mentor is satisfied that the mentee has a good grasp of the project. This may slip to week 3 depending on the project complexity. |
| Checkpoint meeting  | Mentor and mentee meet to evaluate progress. |
| **Week 3 - 5**  |---|
| Continuation of project | Mentee continues working on the project that may consist of submitting multiple pull requests.<br/><br/>Mentor keeps tabs on the PRs to help unblock the mentee. |
| Checkpoint meeting  | Mentor and mentee meet to evaluate progress.<br/><br/>At this point meetings can be more lightweight and done via chat or email. |
| **Week 6**  |---|
| Completion of project | Mentee completes work on the project with ideally all submitted PRs accepted. Mentee may continue working on any outstanding PRs after the mentorship ends.<br/><br/>Mentor keeps tabs on the PRs to help unblock the mentee. |
| Final review meeting setup  | Mentor sets up a final review meeting and provides any special instructions and a survey feedback link. Mentor notifies program admin that the mentorship is coming to an end. |
| **Post-Mentorship**  |---|
| Final review meeting  | Mentor and mentee meet to go over the final progress report and provide feedback including online survey feedback.  |
| Mentorship review meeting  | Program admins collect feedback from the mentor on the mentee's experience and the overall program.  |
| Mentee check-in  | Mentor or program admin checks in with the mentee after a certain time period to find out about their continued open source journey. |
