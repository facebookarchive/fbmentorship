As part of [the program](ProgramOverview.md), you'll be guided through how to get started with contributing to open source. Your guided tour will involve working on an issue in an existing open source project, most likely a Facebook project.

## Initial Training

The program will take you through 3 phases:

1. Ensuring you're comfortable with Git and GitHub.
1. Getting you setup with the project you'll be working with.
1. Working on your project assignment.

The first phase is what you'll need to get started as a contributor.

Watch this [Beginning Git](https://videos.raywenderlich.com/courses/86-beginning-git/lessons/1) tutorial on raywenderlich.com if you're new to Git. It's pretty useful even if you have prior experience with Git.

Check out the [Mastering Git](https://videos.raywenderlich.com/courses/87-mastering-git/lessons/1) course as well. It covers advanced topics such as handling merge conflicts, something you're sure to encounter in your contributor life.

Your mentor will guide you on which videos you should watch and check in on you to make sure you've done this. You'll also be given related exercises to complete to ensure you're comfortable with Git and GitHub.
