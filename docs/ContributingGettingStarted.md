Here's some steps you can take once you've identified a project you want to contribute to.

Finding a project to contribute to can be challenging. You should look to contribute to projects you're actively using. If you're interested in contributing to a project you haven't started using, then take a step back and use it for some time.

Typical contribution steps:

1. Create an account on GitHub
1. Explore the repository you want to contribute to.
1. Use the project and get familiar with how it works.
1. Lurk on any support channels to see how things work within that project's community.
1. Look for beginner tasks. Most projects add labels to issues that are good first tasks. The labels usually differ from one project to another, but are often like 'starter-task', 'first-task', 'easy', 'beginner', and so on.
1. Once you've found an issue, comment on it to let the project maintainer and the community know that you want to tackle it.
1. Create a pull request and reference the related issue so the community is aware that there's on-going work.
