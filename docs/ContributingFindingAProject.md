Generally, finding an open source project to contribute to can be challenging. The recommendation is to contribute to projects you're actively using or to technology you're familiar with.

As a mentee in the program, you should be familar with the technology behind the projects you want to work on. For example, if you want to work on Machine Learning projects, you should have Machine Learning experience.

You'll be matched with a mentor who's also familiar with that tech. The mentor will identify one or more projects that you can work on as well as potential issue(s) to tackle.

## Project Onboarding

Once you're familiar with the basics of using GitHub, your mentor will guide you through setting up the environment you need for the project you'll be working on. This will take the form of completing a series of onboarding tasks to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Working on Other Projects

You may find that you want to work on projects outside what your mentor has recommended. This is something you can work out with your mentor. You just need to demonstrate to your mentor that you're comfortable using the project you wish to contribute to.

Typically, you'd finding alternate projects by:

1. Exploring the repository you want to contribute to.
1. Using the project and get familiar with how it works.
1. Lurking on any support channels to see how things work within that project's community.
1. Looking for beginner tasks. Most projects add labels to issues that are good first tasks. The labels usually differ from one project to another, but are often like 'starter-task', 'first-task', 'easy', 'beginner', and so on.
