As a mentor, you're expected to be the main point of contact for the mentees who want to make meaningful contributions to open source. At a first approximation, the work involved might be similar to bootcamp mentoring, if you've done it; with an additional component of teaching software engineering.

**You are their main point of contact, and the majority of the mentee's experience (good or bad) will depend on you**

The goal of the program is to get mentees familiar with making open source contributions, and trying to get them self sufficient. It's fine if they don't make a large amount of contributions, as long as they are able to dig in on their own and make a contribution independently by the end of it; so they can be self-sufficient. **(NB: Someone should check my assumptions here)**

You will be expected to:

* Teach:
    * Help mentees get familiar with how to make open source contributions
    * Help them understand how to write good commits
    * Help them write good, clean code
    * Teach them how to effectively communicate and navigate the world of open source. Teach them the skills needed to be an effective team player in a larger software engineering team.
    * Help them grow their own mentoring skills. We want mentees to pay it forward by becoming mentors for people in the future. Try to have them identify issues they can train others on.
* Support:
    * Answer any technical questions they may have: you don't have to know the right answer, but you should help them figure out how to get an answer, by helping them read code, or contacting project maintainers
    * Help them with any concerns they may have about the program, personally or technically
    * Understand their aims from the program, and work with them to achieve them. (e.g. do they want to make a ton of contributions? do they just want to learn how to make one really good contribution)
    * (Optional but strongly suggest) Maintain contact and periodically check-in with them long after the program ends.
* Manage:
    * Make sure they are progressing at a reasonable rate
    * Check-in to make sure they are supported and not blocked on external factors
    * Gathering feedback about the program
    * Providing feedback to program admins
