Having a regular check-in with your mentees is ideal for the success for the program. Think of it as your regular 1:1s with your manager. This is the time for your mentee to talk to you and share any concerns they have, and talk about both their questions and their work.

## Before the first meeting

The program admins will connect you to the mentees.

Send out an email introducing yourself to the mentee. This should be a personalized introduction talking about how you're excited to work with them, etc etc.

Based on your availability, also suggest 2-4 timings for a first meeting. Set aside 45 mins (in case meeting runs long) and take into account the other person's schedule. In case they can't make those timings, ask them what a preferred time is and try to make sure it's not inconvenient for your mentee.

## First meeting

Set aside a lot of time for your first meeting since you'll have to cover a lot of material.

In the first meeting, make sure to set all the expectations of the program clearly. I found this overall flow to be helpful:

* Introduce yourself: “Hi, I'm X, I work at Facebook on Y, I'm from Z, etc” — get the mentee comfortable and build up a relationship
* Ask them to introduce themselves - ask about their work/school, what interested them in the program, etc - try to be genuinely interested and build a friendship
* Ask about their interests, why they applied for the program, what they like about it, and what they would like to get out of it. Also try to gauge their technical expertise so you can plan starter tasks and the rest of the program accordingly
* Introduce them to what the program is, and what their expectations are. Reference this flyer (TODO) and talk about how the expectation is for them to focus on learning and making a meaningful contribution; not necessarily to hit one check-list of things to do.
* Set the expectations for regular check-ins, filling out status updates, and what your availability is and how they can best reach you.
* Corollary to the above two points: emphasize the program is about learning and their growth and it's okay if they need to take some time away from the program to focus on life, studies, exams, etc. Try to cultivate a solid relationship so they feel comfortable letting you know they'll be away, versus just disappearing.
* Talk about how you'll be there to support them through the program by providing advice on how to proceed and some limited technical debugging here and there.
* Review their questions and concerns about the starter tasks they would have already done (to get familiar with the program / github).
* Try to set some ramp-up tasks for the specific projects they're interested in (like compiling it, reading documentation, etc) — to set the stage for getting them comfortable with the work.


Talking about working at Facebook, or the engineering culture here, and spending a few minutes on that usually really helps with mentee engagement.


## Follow-up meetings

Before the meeting: go over their status update / report (TODO: link to the template).
If they haven't had time to fill it out, ask them to describe it verbally and ask them to fill it in during/after the meeting.

During the meeting, this flow usually helps:


* Ask how their week was
* Talk about your week, throw in some tidbit about engineering at Facebook
* Discuss the status update:
    * Acknowledge their work and emphasize how great it is
    * Ask what they liked about it and what they didn't
    * Talk about technical concerns about the work and how they can improve their code (if they can)
    * Discuss aspects of communication / how to improve on PRs
    * Ask about their plans for the next week and how you can help with them

## Final meeting

The final meeting is an important one - you want to have a last check-in and ask how things went, gather feedback, and end at a good note.

Try to cover the following:


* Cover the achievements the mentee has made and congratulate them for that. Try to have notes of those so we can keep a record to improve the program
* Talk about how you enjoyed working with them, what you learnt from working with them, how others value their contributions, etc
* Ask for their feedback about the program: what they liked, what they disliked, and how they feel it could be improved. Mention that they should expect to receive a survey about this.
* Mention that they should expect to receive some swag from the program, and that the admins might reach out to them for contact/postal info.
* Ask them to stay in touch - and offer to follow up on that. Mention that we'd like to stay in touch for getting future stories to encourage the growth of the program.
* Ask them if they'd like to continue the relationship in a low-touch manner for seeking advice in the future. Mentees will sometimes have some questions about open source as they navigate things on their own after the program, with the frequency of communication tapering off
* Try to encourage them to become a mentor in the future to help others in their community contribute to open source
* Ask if they have any pending items they'd like to complete / get help with before they formally stop working on it. It could be a PR that needs a couple of days, for example. Offer to help that get tied off before you formally ramp down.
* Above all - make sure things end on a good note, with the mentee happy, and that there are no loose ends (or that there is a plan for addressing those)
