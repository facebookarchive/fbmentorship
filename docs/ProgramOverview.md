For first time contributors, getting started in open source can be quite daunting. The good news is that there are resources and programs out there that want to help would-be newbies overcome this hurdle. 

## Facebook Open Source Mentorship Program

Facebook Open Source has a **6-week, free mentorship** program to introduce developers to open source. Mentees will be mentored by a Facebook engineer to work on a selected open source project. The intent is to teach mentees about open source and assumes familiarity with the tech behind the project.

Mentees are expected to commit **10 hours per week** to complete the tasks assigned by the mentor.

At the end of the program, mentees get feedback on what worked well and areas to improve on. We’ll look for candid feedback on the program and how it was run so we can continue to improve it.

### When 

Applications are being accepted on a rolling-basis and the start dates are flexible. **There is no closing date** for applications. 

Actual mentorship start and end dates will be mutually agreed upon with the mentor depending on availability.

### Where

During the mentorship, mentors will meet with mentees regularly online to review code and answer questions.

### Who Can Apply

We invite any applicants with a passion for tech. No open source experience necessary but experience using Facebook or non-Facebook open source projects is a plus. We’re looking for a diverse range of experiences.
