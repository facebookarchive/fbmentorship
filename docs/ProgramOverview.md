For first time contributors, getting started in open source can be quite daunting. The good news is that there are resources and programs out there that want to help would-be newbies overcome this hurdle. 

## Facebook Open Source Mentorship Program

Facebook Open Source has a **6-week, free mentorship** program to introduce developers to open source. Mentees will be mentored by a Facebook engineer to work on a selected open source project. The intent is to teach mentees about open source and assumes familiarity with the tech behind the project.

Mentees are expected to commit **10 hours per week** to complete the tasks assigned by the mentor.

At the end of the program, mentees get feedback on what worked well and areas to improve on. Weâ€™ll look for candid feedback on the program and how it was run so we can continue to improve it.
