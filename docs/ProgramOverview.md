title: Facebook Open Source Mentorship Program
sidebar_label: Overview
---

Facebook Open Source has a 6-week mentorship program to introduce developers to open source. In this program, mentees will be mentored by a Facebook Engineer to work on a selected open source project.

As a mentee, you are expected to commit 10 hours per week to complete the tasks assigned by your mentor. Your mentor will meet you regularly online to review your code and answer any questions you have.

At the end of the program, you'll get feedback on what worked well and areas to improve on. We’ll look for candid feedback on the program and how it was run so we can continue to improve it.

## Who

We invite any applicants with a passion for tech. No open source experience necessary but experience using Facebook or non-Facebook open source projects is a plus. We’re looking for a diverse range of experiences.

## Where

Online, with weekly check-in meetings.

## When

Start and end dates will be mutually agreed upon with the mentor depending on availability.
